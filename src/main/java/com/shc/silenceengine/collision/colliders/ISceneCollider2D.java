/**
 * Interface that specifies how a 2D Scene collider should behave.
 * In SilenceEngine, a SceneCollider is an object that manages
 * the collision detection of all the objects in a scene automatically
 * for you.
 * <p>
 * The ISceneCollider2D defines a SceneCollider for 2D entities in the scene,
 * i.e., the objects which extend from the Entity2D class. By default,
 * collisions will not be checked for the entities that are present.
 * You are required to register the types of entities to test for collisions
 * using the register() method like in this example.
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *     register(Player.class, Enemy.class);
 *     register(Player.class, EnemyBullet.class);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In the above example, collisions are checked between Player-Enemy
 * and Player-EnemyBullet, and others are just ignored.
